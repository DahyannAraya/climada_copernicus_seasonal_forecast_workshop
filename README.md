# **Copernicus Seasonal Forecast Module** 

<img src="images/repo_qr.png" alt="Repository QR Code" width="150"/>

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that showcases the functionalities of the new **seasonal forecast module** of [CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/). The module facilitates the management of **seasonal forecast data** from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) (CDS) as part of the [U-CLIMADAPT project](https://www.copernicus-user-uptake.eu/user-uptake/details/responding-to-the-impact-of-climate-change-u-climadapt-488). 
This module provides comprehensive tools for downloading, processing, and computing climate indices, as well as generating hazard objects based on seasonal forecast datasets, particularly [Seasonal forecast daily and subdaily data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/seasonal-original-single-levels?tab=overview). 
Designed for seamless integration with the [CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/) (CLIMate ADAptation) platform, this module supports climate risk assessment and facilitates the development of effective adaptation strategies.


## **Features**
- üì• **Download** seasonal forecast data from CDS.
- üîÑ **Process** raw seasonal forecast datasets.
- üìä **Compute climate indices** for analysis.
- üåç **Generate hazard objects** for climate risk assessment.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Integration with [CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/)** (CLIMate ADAptation) for climate impact modeling.

## **Requirements**
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install climada climada_petals cdsapi numpy pandas matplotlib
```
