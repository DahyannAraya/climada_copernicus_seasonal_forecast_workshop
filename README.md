# **Copernicus Seasonal Forecast Module**

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates how to manage **seasonal forecast data** from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) as part of the **U-CLIMADAPT project**. It provides tools for downloading, processing, and computing climate indices to generate hazard objects for **seasonal forecast risk assessment**.

## **Features**
- üì• **Download** seasonal forecast data from CDS.
- üîÑ **Process** raw seasonal forecast datasets.
- üìä **Compute climate indices** for analysis.
- üåç **Generate hazard objects** for climate risk assessment.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Integration with [CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/)** (CLIMate ADAptation) for climate impact modeling.

## **Requirements**
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install climada climada_petals cdsapi numpy pandas matplotlib
```
