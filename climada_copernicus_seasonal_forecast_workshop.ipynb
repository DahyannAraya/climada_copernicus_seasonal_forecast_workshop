        "\n",
        "This module is developed to manage seasonal forecast data from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) (CDS) for the [U-CLIMADAPT project](https://www.copernicus-user-uptake.eu/user-uptake/details/responding-to-the-impact-of-climate-change-u-climadapt-488).\n",
        "It offers comprehensive tools for downloading, processing, computing climate indices, and generating hazard objects based on seasonal forecast datasets, particularly [Seasonal forecast daily and subdaily data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/seasonal-original-single-levels?tab=overview).\n",
        "The module is tailored to integrate seamlessly with the [CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/)(CLIMate ADAptation) platform, supporting climate risk assessment and the development of effective adaptation strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Features:\n",
        "- Download seasonal forecast data from CDS\n",
        "- Process raw data into climate indices\n",
        "- Calculate various heat-related indices (e.g., Maximum Temperature, Tropical Nights)\n",
        "- Create CLIMADA Hazard objects for further risk analysis\n",
        "- Visualize hazard data\n",

        "\n",
        "Usage:\n",
        "This module is typically imported and used within larger scripts or applications for climate data processing\n",
        "and risk assessment. See individual function docstrings for specific usage instructions.\n",
        "\n",

These parameters influence how the forecast data is processed and transformed into a hazard object.\n",
